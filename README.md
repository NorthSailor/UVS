# UVS
A next-gen universal vehicle simulator.

## Project Goals; Why yet another simulator?
UVS strives to provide a simulator designed for the future, with the latest technologies available used.
### Project Stage
At this point, UVS is in pre-alpha stage. This means that it is more of a developing concept than ready to use software.

## Building
Building should be fairly straightforward. Install the SDL development libraries and OpenGL and you're all set.

## Running
It is essential that you have the assets in place and also that you run UVS from the root of the source tree.
It expects to find the `Resources` and the `Shaders` folders so if you want to move it you need those two folders as well.
