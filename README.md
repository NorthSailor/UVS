# UVS
A next-gen universal vehicle simulator.

## Project Goals; Why yet another simulator?
UVS strives to provide a simulator designed for the future, with the latest technologies available used.
### Project Stage
At this point, UVS is in pre-alpha stage. This means that it is more of a developing concept than ready to use software.

## Building
Building should be fairly straightforward. Install the SDL development libraries and OpenGL and you're all set.
To generate the documentation you need to have doxygen and dot installed. 
On an Ubuntu system, you need to install the `doxygen` and `graphviz` packages.
Should these packages be installed, you only need to type `doxygen` at the root of the source tree.

## Running
It is essential that you have the assets in place and also that you run UVS from the root of the source tree.
It expects to find the `Resources` and the `Shaders` folders so if you want to move it you need those two folders as well.
